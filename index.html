        The W3C Core Mobile Web Platform Community Group (Coremob) was established with the objective of helping to make the Web a compelling platform for developing modern mobile applications. The motivation for that is the widespread view that the Web does not represent a compelling platform for mobile applications today.

        This document presents a small number of simple mobile Web application use cases. It goes on to list features that the underlying mobile Web platform needs to offer to support those use cases. It then lists technology standards (primarily W3C Recommendations) that describe those features - and also notes the current state of development of such specifications, noting also where such specification do not at present exist.

        The purpose of the document is to promote understanding of which areas of Web technology are in need of development, and to encourage prioritization of those areas for specification, implementation and testing.

        Other aspects of Coremob's work, which includes the collation and specification of test suites to assess conformance to referenced standards, and the specification of a framework within which such conformance testing might be assessed are referenced.

      Comments on this document are not only welcomed but are actively solicited and should be made on the [public-coremob@w3.org mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-coremob/). The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/coremob/coremob-2012).
    </section>
    

    Introduction
    ============
      
Quoting from its [charter](http://www.w3.org/community/coremob/charter/): 

> The goal of the Core Mobile Web Platform (Coremob) Community Group (CG) is to accelerate the adoption of the Mobile Web as a compelling platform for the development of modern mobile Web applications. In order to achieve this mission, the CG brings developers, equipment manufacturers, browser vendors, operators and other relevant members of the industry together to:

> 1. Agree on core features developers can depend on. These will be defined by reference to a variety of other specifications from the W3C and other standards bodies.
> 1. Compile related conformance test suites.
> 1. Provide to W3C (and non-W3C) groups use cases, scenarios, and other input to drive successful mobile deployment.

This document is the initial output of the Community Group. Its focus is items 1 and 3 from the CG charter above.

The following sections serve to contextualize the role of this document against the CG charter.

### Audience

The primary audience for this document is standardization groups within the W3C as well as equipment manufacturers and browser vendors. The CG also intends it to be of interest to others in its chartered constituency, especially developers, for feedback on the selection of use cases and the derivation of technology requirements from those use cases.

### Goals

In respect of CG Charter item 1. above, developers should be able to rely upon a set of Web technologies being consistently present and interoperably implemented across a wide range of browsers. 

It is not reasonable or practical to think that all technology specifications advance at a similar rate or that all are of equally widespread utility. In addition, some depend on others. Consequently, the intention of the Community Group is to produce a number descriptions of subsets of Web platform technology specifications, which will provide for increasingly sophisticated application use cases. 

This document is the first in such a series of descriptions of subsets of Web platform technologies, and provides for a limited, or base set, of mobile application use cases.

### Methodology 

The use cases chosen reflect a selection of popular applications that have been created using "native" techniques. Although this set of use cases is limited, and the functionality implied by them is (relatively speaking) simple, the set of functionalities is nonetheless described as being "aspirational" because it goes beyond the state of implementation by most current browsers, and indeed goes beyond the current state of specification of some of those features - see below [Aspirational nature of the document](#aspirational-nature-of-the-document) for a discussion of the aspirational aspect, as construed in this revision. 

Having identified features of the Web platform that are required to fulfill the use cases it is then possible to identify a set of technology specifications (or to note the absence of suitable specifications) that specify those features.

Further, having identified a set of specifications, it is then possible to identify a set of tests (or note the absence of such tests) that can be used to assess conformance with the identified specifications and also to propose a test environment in which those tests can be carried out.

### Purpose of this Document

This document, as mentioned above, sets out the initial limited set of use cases; it derives Web platform technology requirements from them and it identifies technology specifications, at various states of maturity, that fulfill those requirements. It does not identify tests or test suites that match those technology specifications, which will be part of subsequent work of the group.

Since standardization work is required to complete the set of technologies required to fulfill the various use cases the document identifies, one of the purposes of the document is to point out that increased coordination between the groups that create standards would be beneficial in order to create a more coherent and pragmatically useful mobile Web application platform. 

The intention of this document and subsequent editions, in regard of developers, is to solicit feedback on the use cases and on specific technology areas that are problematic, when used in a mobile context. Developers are especially encouraged to contribute to the work of the CG, since it is hoped that such participation will reduce future maintenance and development costs for them and will also provide a means by which developers' voices may be heard by constituencies that need to hear them.

### Aspirational nature of the document

To be clear, the CG is not expressing the judgment that it is not possible to use the Web platform to build a wide variety of application that can be used in a mobile context. Indeed, there are applications that can be built on the Web platform that work well in a mobile delivery context. The group notes, though, that those applications are not usually specifically mobile in their use cases and tend to be similar in nature to applications that have desktop use cases as much as they have mobile use cases.

Further, the view that it is already practical to develop effective mobile Web applications is expressed with the caveat that there are many "quality of implementation" issues that developers may encounter. For example, the frame rate achievable when developing mobile games may not be sufficient, in some cases, and as another example the synchronization of playing sounds may not be adequate.

### Mobile Focus

Mobile devices often have capabilities (such as a camera) or circumstances of use (such as periods off line, or frequent periods with low bandwidth for data transfer) that make mobile both a more rewarding environment for creation of applications and a more difficult environment for such implementations too.

With the rapid increase in uptake of use of mobile devices, both in developed markets and in less developed markets (perhaps as the only means of Web access in those markets), the CG believes that closing the gap between what can be achieved using Web technology on mobile and what can be achieved using "native application implementations" needs to narrow, urgently.

### Other aspects of the CG's work

Other aspects of the CG's work, as mentioned in its charter, continue in parallel to the development of this document. Those activities include a "Gap analysis" of where there are existing test suites relevant to the technologies identified in this document, as well as discussion of a Test Framework within which to execute tests of the conformance of implementations of technologies identified here.

The CG's [Web site](http://www.w3.org/community/coremob/) and [Wiki](http://www.w3.org/community/coremob/wiki/) contain links to various aspects of the group's work.

### Structure

The document has the following structure:

    1.  Introduction
        
        This section, containing information about the document, its history and its scope.
        
    2.  Use Cases
        
        Discusses the Use Cases that have been used to derive the requirements of Web technologies.
        
    3.  Required Technologies
        
        Discusses in abstract terms what technologies are needed to support the use cases.
        
    4.  Specifications Selected
        
        Discusses the specifications selected to implement "required technologies".
        
    5.  Missing Specifications
            
        Discusses technologies needed but not specified.

    6.  Quality of Implementation
            
        Discusses aspects of implementation of some of the selected technologies

Use cases
=========

    The basis of selection of the Use Cases is a survey **`need to provide reference`** carried out which assessed the top 10 "Native apps" ...**`discuss here where this all started. This really needs to be here, since the use cases presented here are quite limp and the following paragraph needs to be sustained`**

    The following is a limited, indicative and idealized set of Use Cases intended to summarize those applications identified above.
    
    Take pictures in a remote area without network coverage
    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    Jenna is hiking in a remote area without network coverage. She takes high quality pictures using a Web application. The pictures are stored locally. She decides to post-process some of the pictures she took by applying ready-made filters. She is able to continue taking pictures while the filters are applied. When she returns to an area with better network coverage, her pictures are updated to a remote server. While the upload is going on in the background she can continue taking pictures or can browse her previous shots to select the ones she wants to share with her friends.

    <a href="#req-file-storage" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-file-upload" class="reqRef"></a>.
    
    Record voice memos
    ------------------
    
    While on his morning commute, John records a short voice memo using a Web application. As he is offline, the audio file is stored locally. When he reaches the office, the audio file is asynchronously uploaded to the application's servers where it is transcribed. The application notifies John when the transcription is finished and the content of his voice memo is available as raw text.

    <a href="#req-file-upload" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-server-sent-events" class="reqRef"></a>.
    
    Play a 2D Game
    ---------------
    
    Fantastic Rafaela Sis' is a platform game the goal of which is to save an imprisoned prince. This is done by navigating a character, Rafaela, across various levels from left to right. Each levels consist of a series of obstacles and enemies that the player has to avoid (by jumping over, shooting, etc). The character is controlled by tilting the device. Consequently, the game must be locked in landscape mode to avoid auto-rotation of the viewport interfering with the game play. It has a soundtrack per level and various sound effects.
    
    Derived requirements:
    <a href="#req-orientation-lock" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-fullscreen" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-position" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-framerate" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-audio-playback" class="reqRef"></a>.
    
    Find the nearest subway station
    -------------------------------
    
    Jo uses public transportation to visit his clients scattered around town. In order to find his way around he relies on a Web application that is able to locate him on a map, display the closest subway station and indicate in which direction he should walk to find it.
    
    Derived requirements:
    <a href="#req-geolocation" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-position" class="reqRef"></a>.
    
    View a regular website
    ----------------------
    
    Anette is using her mobile device to access her bank's website. Although her bank has a dedicated native application _and_ a mobile version of its site, the information she's looking for is only available on the main site. She's nonetheless able to consult it because her mobile device supports the same set of Web standards her desktop browser does, and is capable of displaying that information despite the difference in screen size and pixel density.
    
    Derived requirements:
    <a href="#req-interoperability" class="reqRef"></a>,
    <a href="#req-viewport" class="reqRef"></a>.
    
    Bookmarking a Web application
    -----------------------------
    
    Paul uses the same Web mail client on various devices and user agents. He would like to bookmark it so that it is easily recognizable across his different devices yet blends in with how other applications are portrayed in the given environment.
    
    Derived requirements:
    <a href="#req-meta-data" class="reqRef"></a>.
    
    Derived Requirements

    Specifications which meet the derived requirements
    ==================================================
    
    This section lists existing specifications which address the requirements expressed in <a href="#use-cases" class="sectionRef"></a> and <a href="#derived-requirements" class="sectionRef"></a> and and notes their current state of standardization (progress along W3C Rec Track is noted using conventional abbreviations)

    The document [Standards for Web Applications on Mobile: current state and roadmap](http://www.w3.org/Mobile/mobile-web-app-state/)  is regularly updated to reflect current status both of standardization and of implementation of many of the same standards.


    <p class="note">The CG has had frequent cause to discuss whether or not it needs to make reference to **the whole** of a referenced specification. In the course of such discussions it has frequently re-iterated that it is not its role to cherry-pick parts of the specifications produced by other groups. Equally, however, it has frequently noted that its use cases require only sub-sections of referenced specifications. The CG has observed that the WGs responsible for producing such specifications might choose to subset their work to advance speed of specification, modularity of testing and so on.</p>

   **`Each of the entries below that don't have a specific requirement against them require justification`**
    
   **`I can't figure out how to assess whether the link to the reference is correct and consistent with the Work status stated in this table`**

    Requirements unmet by current specification work
    ================================================
    
**`This section needs to list the requirements by number`**

**`Plus it would be useful to have a summary at the end tabulating where requirements are and are not met`**

    Application Configuration
    -------------------------
    
    <p class='issue' data-number=6>WebApps WG is [chartered](http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/Overview.html#deliverables) to work on this and has two related specs: Widget Packaging and Configuration [[WIDGETS]] (which has had little traction among the main vendors), and Web Application Manifest Format and Management APIs [[WEBAPPS-MANIFEST-API]] (which is still an early Editor's draft).</p>
    
    Application Cache
    -----------------
    
    <p class='issue' data-number=1>Some [critical AppCache issues](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14702) are being [fixed](http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=7135&amp;to=7136) in the HTML Living Standard spec. Unfortunately, these fixes aren't brought (yet) to the HTML5 spec because they are considered new features belonging in HTML.next. What should the group's position be with regards to that?</p>
    
    View Orientation
    ----------------
    
    <p class='issue' data-number=7>This is a new deliverable of the WebApps WG. See the WG's [charter](http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/) for details. No spec to link to for the moment. Could also end up as an attribute of [Application Configuration](#application-configuration).</p>
    
    Chromeless Mode
    ---------------
    
    <p class='issue' data-number=8>Within the scope of the WebApps WG's [charter](http://www.w3.org/2012/webapps/charter/). Could end up as an attribute of [Application Configuration](#application-configuration).</p>
    
    Momentum and infinite scrolling
    -------------------------------
    
    <p class='issue' data-number=11>Request for momentum scrolling (e.g. `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`) are extremely common. Unfortunately, there is no spec effort at this point.</p>

    Quality of Implementation Requirements
    ======================================
    
    The CG notes that functional conformance to specifications is sometimes insufficient to create a functional user experience of Web applications. There are many areas in which non-functional (or QoI) requirements have been noted, relating to speed, time related consistency (smoothness) and so on. 

    The group's work to date has yielded two particular points of note.
    
    <p class='note'>Implementors should pay particular attention to the quality of implementation of the `audio` element. `audio` elements are commonly used in games to play background music and sound effects. It is recommended that implementations support playing 8 audio files in parallel without audible artifacts and provide sub 10ms latency.</p>
    
    <p class='note'>Implementors should pay attention to the performance characteristics of the `canvas` element which is particularly well suited for the development of 2D and isometric games. In order to meet the expectations of users, implementations should be capable of running such games at 30fps in full-screen mode.</p>
    
    Conformance
    ===========

This document does not express any conformance requirements. Conformance to this document would consist of conforming to the technology standards it identifies, however, some of the technology standards it identifies have not advanced to a sufficient state of maturity to be capable of having conformance requirements.
